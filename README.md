## Introduction

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

The end goal of this project is to make a simple proof of concept of a RESTful API with Go using gorilla/mux.

If you're have not encountered Go before, you should visit this website [here](https://golang.org/doc/install).

## Environment

The `.env.example` file is provided in the root directory to provide development environment variables change it to `.env` to make it work.

## Run

To run the code, you will need docker and docker-compose installed on your machine. In the project root, run `docker compose up`.

You can run it manually without docker using the command `go run ./cmd/todo` or `make run`, to make it work, the environment variable `MONGO_HOST=localhost` must be changed in the .env file to `localhost` instead of the mongo container name.

After that, you have a RESTful API that is running at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

## Project Layout

The project uses the following project layout:

```text
.
â”œâ”€â”€ cmd                main applications of the project
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ todo             the api server setup
â”œâ”€â”€ docs               api documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ integration        integration tests
â”œâ”€â”€ internal           private application and library code
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config           configuration library
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ platform         mongo db client
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ todo             todo related features
â”‚        â””â”€â”€ note          note related features
â”œâ”€â”€ pkg                public library code
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ error            standard api errors
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ health           health check definition
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ util             utils to handle http requests
â””â”€â”€  third_party          third party libraries
     â””â”€â”€ swagger-ui      static files from swagger ui

```

The top level directories `cmd`, `internal`, `pkg` are commonly found in other popular Go projects, as explained in
[Standard Go Project Layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout).

Within `internal` and `pkg`, packages are structured by features in order to achieve the so-called
[screaming architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2011/09/30/Screaming-Architecture.html). For example,
the `todo` directory contains the application logic related with the todo feature.

Within each feature package, code are organized in layers (handlers, service, repository), following the dependency guidelines
as described in the [clean architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).

## Logging

Logging plays a vital role in identifying issues, evaluating performances, and knowing the process status within the application. For this reason it was decided to select structured logging, using Uber's library [Zap](https://github.com/uber-go/zap).

### Log levels

For simplicity it was decided to use three types of log levels

- `Info`  Generally useful information to log.
- `Error` Anything that can potentially cause application oddities including 50x server errors.
- `Fatal` Any error that is forcing a shutdown of the service or application to prevent data loss.

### Log body

The log itself is a json structure with the following keys

- `level`       define log level
- `ts`          define log timestamp
- `caller`      define the file where the log was called
- `msg`         define the main info of the log
- `method`      define the request method
- `url`         define the resource called in the api
- `statusCode`  define the response status code
- `duration`    define the duration of the request in nanoseconds
- `details`     define extra error information
- `stacktrace`  define extra trace information

Logging was included at the beginning and end of the requests in order to maintain traceability.

### Example of Create Note Request

```js
POST api/v1/notes
```

```json
{
    "name": "Go to the bank",
    "description":"Schedule an appointment to the bank",
}
 ```

### Example of Create Note Request Logging

```json
{
    "level": "info",
    "ts": 1674960805.3700233,
    "caller": "todo/middleware.go:64",
    "msg": "Start http request",
    "method": "POST",
    "url": "/api/v1/notes"
}
 ```

### Example of Create Note Response Logging

```json
{
    "level": "info",
    "ts": 1674960805.3718014,
    "caller": "todo/middleware.go:87",
    "msg": "Finish http request",
    "method": "POST",
    "url": "/api/v1/notes",
    "statusCode": 201,
    "duration": 0.0017783
}
 ```

### Example of Fatal level error when .env file is missing

```json
{
    "level": "fatal",
    "ts": 1674963617.935728,
    "caller": "todo/main.go:29",
    "msg": "Cannot load config",
    "details": "Config File \".env\" Not Found in \"[C:\\\\Users\\\\User\\\\Documents\\\\todo-api-golang C:\\\\Users\\\\User\\\\Documents\\\\todo-api-golang\\\\cmd\\\\todo]\"",
    "stacktrace": "main.main\n\tC:/Users/User/Documents/todo-api-golang/cmd/todo/main.go:29\nruntime.main\n\tC:/Program Files/Go/src/runtime/proc.go:250"
}
 ```

### Example of Error level error when 500 error occurs

In this case a body of the response is included to provide additional information in order to identify the issue.

```json
{
    "level": "error",
    "ts": 1674965353.375559,
    "caller": "todo/middleware.go:84",
    "msg": "Finish http request",
    "method": "POST",
    "url": "/api/v1/notes",
    "statusCode": 500,
    "duration": 0.0005219,
    "body": "{\"type\":\"INTERNAL\",\"message\":\"Internal server error.\",\"code\":500,\"detail\":\"error creating note id\"}\n",
    "stacktrace": "todo-api-golang/internal/todo.LogMiddleware.func1.1\n\tC:/Users/Chelo/Documents/todo-api-golang/internal/todo/middleware.go:84\nnet/http.HandlerFunc.ServeHTTP\n\tC:/Program Files/Go/src/net/http/server.go:2109\ngithub.com/gorilla/mux.(*Router).ServeHTTP\n\tC:/Users/Chelo/go/pkg/mod/github.com/gorilla/mux@v1.8.0/mux.go:210\nnet/http.serverHandler.ServeHTTP\n\tC:/Program Files/Go/src/net/http/server.go:2947\nnet/http.(*conn).serve\n\tC:/Program Files/Go/src/net/http/server.go:1991"
}
 ```

## Make File

### Local run

Use the command `make run` to run the project, to make it work, the environment variable `MONGO_HOST=localhost` needs to be changed in .env file

### Test coverage

Use the command `make unittest` to run all the unit tests including coverage

### Integration test

Use the command `make integrationtest` to run all the integration tests

### Create and start containers

Use the command `make dcbuild` to create and start all the containers

### Swagger

Use the command `make swagger` to generate the /docs/swagger.yaml and third_party/swagger-ui-4.11.1/swagger.json files from the go-swagger models

### Generate mocks

Use the command `make mocks` to generate the mocks of the interfaces in /internal/todo/note folder.
