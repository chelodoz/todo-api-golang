# "ToDo API" proof of concept

## Introduction

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

The end goal of this project is to make a simple proof of concept of a RESTful API with Go using gorilla/mux.

If you're have not encountered Go before, you should visit this website [here](https://golang.org/doc/install)

## Environment

The `.env.example` file is provided in the root directory to provide development environment variables change it to `.env` to make it work

## Run

To run the code, you will need docker and docker-compose installed on your machine. In the project root, run `docker compose up`.

You can run it manually without docker `cd todo-api-golang/cmd/todo` and run `go run main.go`
Use F5 keyword in vscode to debug it locally as the launch.json has a default configuration

After that, you have a RESTful API that is running at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`. It provides us following endpoints

- `GET api/v1/notes` : it provides us the list of all notes
- `POST api/v1/notes` : it allows the user create a new todo. It saves the todo info into mongo db database and attached data like that:

  - ```JSON
      {
          "name": "Go to the bank",
          "description":"schedule an appointment to the bank",
      }
    ```

- `GET /api/v1/notes/{noteId}` : it allows the user to retrieve a note information of a specific id
- `PATCH /api/v1/notes/{noteId}` : it allows the user to update a note of a specific id

  - ```JSON
      {
          "name": "Go shopping",
          "description":"buy groceries for the week"
      }

    ```

- `GET /api/v1/swagger/` : access the swagger ui to see the api documentation
- `GET /api/v1/health` : return a 200 status with a Healthy response

## Project Layout

The project uses the following project layout:

```text
.
â”œâ”€â”€ cmd                main applications of the project
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ todo             the api server setup
â”œâ”€â”€ docs               api documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ internal           private application and library code
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config           configuration library
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ platform         mongo db client
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ todo             todo related features
â”‚        â””â”€â”€ note          note related features
â”œâ”€â”€ pkg                public library code
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ error            standard api errors
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ health           health check definition
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ util             utils to handle http requests
â””â”€â”€  third_party          third party libraries
     â””â”€â”€ swagger-ui      static files from swagger ui

```

The top level directories `cmd`, `internal`, `pkg` are commonly found in other popular Go projects, as explained in
[Standard Go Project Layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout).

Within `internal` and `pkg`, packages are structured by features in order to achieve the so-called
[screaming architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2011/09/30/Screaming-Architecture.html). For example,
the `todo` directory contains the application logic related with the todo feature.

Within each feature package, code are organized in layers (handlers, service, repository), following the dependency guidelines
as described in the [clean architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).

## Generate swagger documentation

Use the command `make swagger` to generate the /docs/swagger.yaml and third_party/swagger-ui-4.11.1/swagger.json files from the go-swagger models

## Generate mocks

Use the command `make mocks` to generate the mocks of the interfaces in /internal/todo/note folder.
