## Introduction

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

The end goal of this project is to make a simple proof of concept of a RESTful API with Go using gorilla/mux.

If you're have not encountered Go before, you should visit this website [here](https://golang.org/doc/install).

## Environment

The `.env.example` file is provided in the root directory to provide development environment variables change it to `.env` to make it work.

## Run

To run the code, you will need docker and docker-compose installed on your machine. In the project root, run `docker compose up`.

You can run it manually without docker using the command `go run ./cmd/todo` or `make run`, to make it work, the environment variable `MONGO_HOST=localhost` must be changed in the .env file to `localhost` instead of the mongo container name.

After that, you have a RESTful API that is running at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

## Project Layout

The project uses the following project layout:

```text
.
â”œâ”€â”€ cmd                main applications of the project
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ todo             the api server setup
â”œâ”€â”€ docs               api documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ integration        integration tests
â”œâ”€â”€ internal           private application and library code
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config           configuration library
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ platform         mongo db client
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ todo             todo related features
â”‚        â””â”€â”€ note          note related features
â”œâ”€â”€ pkg                public library code
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ error            standard api errors
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ health           health check definition
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ util             utils to handle http requests
â””â”€â”€  third_party          third party libraries
     â””â”€â”€ swagger-ui      static files from swagger ui

```

The top level directories `cmd`, `internal`, `pkg` are commonly found in other popular Go projects, as explained in
[Standard Go Project Layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout).

Within `internal` and `pkg`, packages are structured by features in order to achieve the so-called
[screaming architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2011/09/30/Screaming-Architecture.html). For example,
the `todo` directory contains the application logic related with the todo feature.

Within each feature package, code are organized in layers (handlers, service, repository), following the dependency guidelines
as described in the [clean architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).

## API Definition

    "status":"To Do",
}
 ```

    "status" : "In Progress"
}
```

    "description":"Schedule an appointment to the bank",
    "status" : "In Progress"
  },
]
```

### Get Health

```

```json
{
    "status" : "Healthy"
}
```

### Get Swagger UI

#### Get Swagger UI Request

```js
GET /api/v1/swagger/
```

## Make File

### Local run

Use the command `make run` to run the project, to make it work, the environment variable `MONGO_HOST=localhost` needs to be changed in .env file

### Test coverage

Use the command `make test` to run all the tests including coverage

### Create and start containers

Use the command `make dcbuild` to create and start all the containers

### Swagger

Use the command `make swagger` to generate the /docs/swagger.yaml and third_party/swagger-ui-4.11.1/swagger.json files from the go-swagger models

### Generate mocks

Use the command `make mocks` to generate the mocks of the interfaces in /internal/todo/note folder.
